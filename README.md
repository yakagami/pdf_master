# pdf_master

[中文版本](https://github.com/chengjie-jlu/pdf_master/blob/master/README-zh.md)

pdf_master is a cross-platform PDF document viewer framework built with Flutter, powered by [pdfium](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/).

The project directly uses Dart FFI to query pdfium symbols for PDF rendering, editing, and saving, without writing any native code. This allows for quick compilation and execution, with theoretical support for most platforms (currently Android and iOS are fully implemented).

### Current Features

* Progressive rendering
* Table of contents viewing and navigation
* Text selection and copying
* Add and delete annotations (currently supports highlight annotations)
* Image viewing and extraction
* Page management (add, rotate, delete, etc.)
* Convert to images
* In-document search
* Dark mode

Here's a short demo video:

* Support for more annotation types
* ...
